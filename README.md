# life-expectancy-project

With the vast variety of resources, utilities, and factors around the world associated with our health as a human race, we were intrigued as to what kind of factors held correlations to longer life expectancies around the globe.
To understand the difference in life expectancy throughout the world, we decided we would find its association to key factors such as the prevalence of physicians and pharmacists, basic handwashing, drinking water services, and basic sanitation services. Using data that spans several decades from the past century, we revealed some obvious and not so obvious correlations to the length of human life!

**Research Questions to Answer:**
1. How does access to water effect life expectancy?
2. Do hand washing habits correlate with life expectancy?
3. How does access to basic sanitation services correlate with overall life expectancy?
4. Does the number of Pharmacist in a country’s population correlate with the overall life expectancy?
5. Does the number of Medical Doctors in a country’s population correlate with the overall life expectancy?
6. How do various infrastructural factors correlate with each other  (Medical Doctors per 10,000 vs Population using at least basic sanitization services (%),  etc.)
